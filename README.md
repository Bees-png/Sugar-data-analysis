# Sugar Consumption & Health Analysis (SQL Project)

## Project Overview
This project explores **global sugar consumption trends** and their **health implications** using SQL queries for data analysis.  
The dataset contains information on sugar consumption across different regions and years, along with relevant health statistics such as obesity rates, diabetes prevalence, and other related indicators.  

The goal is to **derive deep insights** into how sugar intake may influence public health, and to present these findings in a way that can support **health policy decisions** and **public awareness campaigns**.

---

## Objectives
- Analyze **annual sugar consumption trends** by country and region.
- Identify countries with **highest and lowest sugar intake**.
- Examine the correlation between **sugar consumption and health outcomes** (e.g., obesity, diabetes).
- Detect unusual spikes or declines in sugar consumption.
- Provide **data-driven recommendations** for health policies.

##  Dataset Information
**File name:** `sugar_consumption_dataset.csv`  
**Key columns:**
- `Country` – Name of the country
- `Year` – Year of record
- `Sugar_Consumption_kg_per_capita` – Annual sugar consumption per person
- `Obesity_Rate_%` – Percentage of obese individuals
- `Diabetes_Prevalence_%` – Percentage of people with diabetes
- `Population` – Population of the country in the given year

## Example Insights from SQL Queries
Some sample questions answered in this project:
1. Which countries consume the most sugar per capita?
2. Has sugar consumption increased or decreased globally over the last decade?
3. Is there a positive correlation between sugar intake and obesity rates?
4. Which countries have reduced sugar consumption the most?
5. How does sugar consumption vary by continent?
6. What is the top 5 countries with fastest-growing sugar consumption?
7. Are there seasonal or year-specific spikes in sugar intake?
8. What is the average sugar consumption in high-income vs low-income countries?
9. Which country has the highest diabetes prevalence linked to sugar consumption?
10. Which regions need urgent sugar reduction policies?


---

## Findings Summary
- Countries with **high sugar intake** tend to show **higher obesity and diabetes prevalence**.
- Some regions have made **significant reductions in sugar consumption** in the last 5 years.
- Middle-income countries are experiencing **fastest growth in sugar intake**.
- Global sugar consumption **peaked in 2018** before a slight decline.

---

## Recommendations
- Governments should **implement sugar tax policies** to discourage overconsumption.
- Promote **public health campaigns** to raise awareness about risks of excessive sugar intake.
- Encourage **food industry reformulation** to reduce sugar content in processed foods.
- Monitor **yearly trends** to assess effectiveness of interventions.
